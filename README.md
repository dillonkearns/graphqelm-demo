# GraphqElm Demo

The purpose of this package is to provide a demo for the
[`Graphqelm` package](https://github.com/dillonkearns/graphqelm)
that can be used in [ellie examples like this one](https://rebrand.ly/graphqelm).
The elm code in this package is auto-generated using
[github.com/dillonkearns/graphqelm](https://github.com/dillonkearns/graphqelm)
based on the schema in this Elixir GraphQL server (see
[schema.ex](https://github.com/dillonkearns/graphqelm-demo/blob/master/lib/star_wars_web/schema.ex)).
The schema is based on [Facebook's reference implementation of the Star Wars API](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).
